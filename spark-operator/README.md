### Spark operator
![Architecture](spark-operator_architecture-diagram.png)

- Following the https://dzlab.github.io/ml/2020/07/14/spark-kubernetes/ article spark-operator was deployed in minikube and spark-pi example job was computed.
- Tried same approach with GARR cloud, but it don't work, look at log in [spark-operator-garr-cloud-error](spark-operator-garr-cloud-error.txt)
    - Reported to Claudio Pisa that has the same issue running with superuser, to better inspect
- Following the second part that sends to operator a scala project
    - Can't push in minikube registry, maybe to configure better https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/registry/

        - Error in push chart at step 10 (chartmuesum mkdir 500 permission denied, probably related to minikube registry issue for GKP spark-on-k8s-operator)

        - Error on permission of service account...
            - Solved using initialization of dzlab demo
        - Trying to deploy python application...
            - Ok in minikube
            - Error in GARR cloud, it's not a permission problem, maybe a version compatibility issue?

        - Deployed operator
        - Runned spark-pi example
        - Following second part... Error in pushing into minikube registry (probably some error on port forwarding?)
            - Need to try another registry like dockerhub
        - Spark-pi example works if spark applications are deployed in the same namespace as spark-operator
            - This means that can be replicated in GARR cloud without create another namespace with edit clusterrole
                - Don't work... for log look at spark-operator-garr-cloud-error.txt
