---- Requirements check

    - OK

---- Story
kubeconfig don't work when launch spark-submit
used app-cred-tcecconello3-openrc.sh to set:
#!/usr/bin/env bash

export OS_AUTH_TYPE=v3applicationcredential
export OS_AUTH_URL=https://keystone.cloud.garr.it:5000/v3
export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
export OS_REGION_NAME="garr-ct1"
export OS_INTERFACE=public
export OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_ID=3f1a92ff2bc54bb9b7ed6260385421d5
export OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_SECRET=Y2ixVqJhn7LTw9NpfCEvymWMrMyr4iMVFBllnLcHfjD3fihV9Xvas-do5IRJvKr5V6uMC-u4uS5x9hZwsPf9aA

UPDATE: the problem was that environment variable $KUBECONFIG was not setted set it with export $KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kube/config

Account and service account spark gained right permission. To check the permissions:
kubectl auth can-i --list --as=system:serviceaccount:g-thomascecconello-unimibit:spark -n g-thomascecconello-unimibit
kubectl auth can-i --list

When run spark-submit the pod don't found the configmaps, seems to be related by trying to access a resource before it's created
